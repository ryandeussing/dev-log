## Publicatios/Subscriptions

The key is that you usually don't want to publish/subscribe to a full collection - you're usually dealing with a specific subset.

You can limit all queries:

```
// server
Meteor.publish('posts', function() {
  return Posts.find({flagged: false}); 
});
```

You can also allow a publication to take a parameter, further limiting specific queries:

```
// server
Meteor.publish('posts', function(author) {
  return Posts.find({flagged: false, author: author});
});
```

```
// client
Meteor.subscribe('posts', 'bob-smith');
```

You can also limit queries on the client - e.g. if you wanted all Bob's posts available in memory, but you only want to display posts of a certain category:

```
// on the client
Template.posts.helpers({
    posts: function(){
        return Posts.find({author: 'bob-smith', category: 'JavaScript'});
    }
});
// presumably you could create an `allPosts` method as well
```

Remember: `autopublish`, which is active by default, just makes whole collections sync. It's there to make getting started easy, but not good for real projects. 

## Publishing Partial Collections

E.g. publishing only posts by a particular author:

```
Meteor.publish('somePosts', function(){
  return Posts.find({'author':'Tom'});
});
```

## Publishing Partial Properties

Use a second object as an argument to control what fields are included (default value is `true`):

```
Meteor.publish('allPosts', function(){
  return Posts.find({}, {fields: {
    date: false
  }});
});
```

```
Meteor.publish('allPosts', function(){
  return Posts.find({'author':'Tom'}, {fields: {
    date: false
  }});
});
```
