## Session

Without a session, the url is the only thing that holds state. 

In Meteor, the session is a **global, reactive data store**. It's available everywhere as `Session`

```
// in the console

Session.set('pageTitle', 'A different title');
```

Note: the session is reactive, if you set it in a helper the changes are realtime as session properties change.

```
// client/views/application/layout.html

<header class="navbar">
  <div class="navbar-inner">
    <a class="brand" href="{{pathFor 'postsList'}}">{{pageTitle}}</a>
  </div>
</header>
```

That adds a `{{ pageTitle }}` variable, which will be set by this helper:

```
// client/views/application/layout.js

Template.layout.helpers({
  pageTitle: function() { return Session.get('pageTitle'); }
});
```

## Autorun

Most data is not reactive.

```
helloWorld = function() {
  alert(Session.get('message'));
}
```

Even though that calles a session variable, it's not in a reactive context - it won't create an alert every time the variable is changed. You can use autorun to force reactivity:

```
Deps.autorun(function() {
  alert(Session.get('message'));
});
```

## Hot code reload & session variables

HCR preserves session variables. It's magic.

1. Always store user state in the Session or the URL so that users are minimally disrupted when a hot code reload happens.

2. Store any state that you want to be shareable between users within the URL itself.
