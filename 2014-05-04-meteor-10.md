## Errors

We want to do better than just `alert()` dialogs

**local collections**

We'll use them to keep track of which errors the user has seen, and showt them new ones (with a flash)

the `Errors` collectio is only associated with the current session, so there's no need to sync with the server. We'll put it in a client-only file, with the collection name set to `null`:

```
// client/helpers/errors.js

Errors = new Meteor.Collection(null);
```

Now we'll create a `throwErrors` function to add errors to the local collection:


```
// client/helpers/errors.js

throwError = function(message) {
  Errors.insert({message: message})
}
```

Like all collections, a local collection is reactive - so we can declaratively display data like any other collection data.
