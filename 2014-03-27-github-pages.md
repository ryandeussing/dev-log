### personal page (e.g. makery.co for makeryco.github.io)

- look at settings for ryandeussing.com
- 2 A records for the naked domain
- a CNAME for www that points to makeryco.github.io
- CNAME file in master branch with `makery.co`

Better setup would be non-naked domain, but need different DNS for that (fastmail doesn't let you use @ alias)
