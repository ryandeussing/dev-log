## Collections

Mongo on the server is your persistent, canonical data source. Clients may have some or all of that data at any time, via Meteor `collections`.

**A collection is not a `model` by another name**. It's a special data structure that uses `publications` and `subscriptions` to handle real-time syncing with clients.

In `collections.posts.js`:

```
Posts = new Meteor.Collection('posts');
```
Note: in Meteor, `var` limits the scope of a variable to the current file, which we don't want here.

That creates a collection that will be available on both the client and the server (_anything_ not in either `client` or `server` is available globally).

On the `server`, the collection is like a standard database library - it talks to Mongo and reads/writes changes as necessary. But on the `client`, the collection is a subset of the server-side collection that gets constantly synced in real-time.

`MiniMongo` is the Meteor client-side Mongo implementation. It lets you run Mongo commands locally, e.g. `db.posts.find();`

Note: `meteor reset` will wipe your database. Use with caution.
