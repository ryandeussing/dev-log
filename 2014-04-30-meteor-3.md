## Collections

Mongo on the server is your persistent, canonical data source. Clients may have some or all of that data at any time, via Meteor `collections`.

**A collection is not a `model` by another name**. It's a special data structure that uses `publications` and `subscriptions` to handle real-time syncing with clients.

In `collections.posts.js`:

```
Posts = new Meteor.Collection('posts');
```
Note: in Meteor, `var` limits the scope of a variable to the current file, which we don't want here.

That creates a collection that will be available on both the client and the server (_anything_ not in either `client` or `server` is available globally).

On the `server`, the collection is like a standard database library - it talks to Mongo and reads/writes changes as necessary. But on the `client`, the collection is a subset of the server-side collection that gets constantly synced in real-time.

`MiniMongo` is the Meteor client-side Mongo implementation. It lets you run Mongo commands locally.

Note: `meteor reset` will wipe your database. Use with caution.

## Fixtures

Now what we have a collection (`Posts`) we can pre-populate our template with data from the database. (Our first technique was just to create dummy `posts` data in the template manager.)

In `server/fixtures.js`:

```
if (Posts.find().count() === 0) {
  Posts.insert({
    title: 'Introducing Telescope',
    author: 'Sacha Greif',
    url: 'http://sachagreif.com/introducing-telescope/'
  });

  Posts.insert({
    title: 'Meteor',
    author: 'Tom Coleman',
    url: 'http://meteor.com'
  });

  Posts.insert({
    title: 'The Meteor Book',
    author: 'Tom Coleman',
    url: 'http://themeteorbook.com'
  });
}
```

This will populate the database when the sever starts, but only when it finds that the database is empty.

Now we'll replace the static data in our template manager with a dynamic collection:

`client/views/posts/posts_list.js`:

```
Template.postsList.helpers({
  posts: function() {
    return Posts.find();
  }
});
```

Note: in Meteor, `find()` returns a `cursor`, which is a `reactive data source`. If you're trying to log the contents of `find()` you need to use `fetch()`, which converts the result to an array. In normal Meteor code, you don't have to do that, b/c Meteor can iterate over cursors without converting them.

At this point, things are already real-time. If you add a post via the browser console, it gets synced to the database and all browsers receive and display it.

## Autopublish

By default, collections are automatically shared in their entirety with connected clients. We don't want this, so:

`meteor remove autopublish`

Now all our posts are missing from the browser. We need to `publish` the `Posts` collection on the server, and `subscribe` to it on the client. (For now, we'll publish the whole enchilada. Eventually, we'll make sure we're only transferring the posts that a user needs to see.)

`server/publications.js`:

```
Meteor.publish('posts', function() {
  return Posts.find();
});
```

`client/main.js`:

```
Meteor.subscribe('posts');
```
