## Routing

`iron-router` is a package that creates paths, and can also take care of filters (assigning actions to paths) and even subscriptions (controlling what paths have access to what data).

**Terminology**

`routes` - a route is the set of instructions that tell the app where to go and what to do when it encounters a URL

`paths` - a path is a URL within your app. It can be static (/terms_of_service) or dynamic (/posts/xyz), and even include query parameters (/search?keyword=meteor)

`segments` - the different parts of a path, delimited by forward slashes (/)

`hooks` - actions that you'd like to perform before, after, or even during the routing process (e.g. checking if the user has the proper rights before displaying a page)

`filters` - hooks that you define globally for one or more routes

`route templates` - each route needs to point to a template (if you don't specify one, the router will look for a template with the same name as the route by default)

`layouts` - layouts contain all the HTML code that wraps the current template, and will remain the same even if the template changes

`controllers` - sometimes, you'll realize that a lot of your templates are reusing the same parameters - rather than duplicate your code, you can let all these routes inherit from a single routing controller which will contain all the routing logic
